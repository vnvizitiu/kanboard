Before to submit your pull-request:

- Be sure that the unit tests pass
- If you create a new feature, test your code, and do not introduce new bugs
- Avoid code duplication
- Remember, small pull-requests are easier to review and can be merged quickly
- 1 pull-request == 1 feature/improvement
- Nonessential features should be implemented as plugin
