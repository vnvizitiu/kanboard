Project Permissions
===================

Each project is isolated from other projects.
Project access must be allowed by the project owner.

Each user and each group can have a different role assigned.
There are 3 types of [roles for projects](roles.markdown):

- Project Manager
- Project Member
- Project Viewer

Only administrators have access to everything.

Role assignments are visible in **Project Settings > Permissions**:

If you choose to allow everybody, all Kanboard users will be considered 'Project Member'.
With this setting, role management will have no effect. Permission per user or per group cannot be applied.

Private projects cannot define permissions.
